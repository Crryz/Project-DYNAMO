# Project-DYNAMO
Silly little guy that might explode.

DYNAMO is my way to redo anki's Cozmo / Vector robot as they have became mostly useless. DYNAMO might be *slightly* less safe than Cozmo but he *definitely* won't explode *(hopefully)*.
DYNAMO will include the basics of Cozmo and hopefully I can integrate Vector's functionalities and more.
