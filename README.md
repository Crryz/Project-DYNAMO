# Project-DYNAMO
Silly little guy that might explode.

DYNAMO is my way to redo anki's Cozmo / Vector robot as they have became mostly useless. DYNAMO might be *slightly* less safe than Cozmo but he *definitely* won't explode *(hopefully)*.
DYNAMO will include the basics of Cozmo and hopefully I can integrate Vector's functionalities and more.

He will also be used in RDL competitions to measure distances for robots and drones to capture measurements for coding purposes, scout locations of things, and more.

This project is not to compete at all with DDL/anki but I want to use this as a project to build my robotics and engineering passion.

For the 4th or 5th time revising this, here is his official specs and his modes that he will cycle through.

**Modes**
==========
AI mode, deafult:
DYNAMO will answer any questions you have for him, will also tell you what's in front of him. He will display his answers on his screen.
Wandering mode:
He will rome around, look at things, act a little clumsy and silly. Just bein himself.
Scout mode:
He will upload his camera stream to a wifi hotspot and you can access it and view said stream. You can also control him with an XBOX controller to move his motors around.
Measure mode:
He will use his HCSR04 to tell you the distance of what he is measuring. Also he can be controlled with a controller during this time.
