# Project-DYNAMO
Silly little guy that might explode.

DYNAMO is my way to redo anki's Cozmo / Vector robot as they have became mostly useless. DYNAMO might be *slightly* less safe than Cozmo but he *definitely* won't explode *(hopefully)*.
DYNAMO will include the basics of Cozmo and hopefully I can integrate Vector's functionalities and more.

He will also be used (hopefully) in RDL competitions to measure distances for robots and drones to capture measurements for coding purposes, scout locations of things, and more.

This project is not to compete at all with DDL/anki but I want to use this as a project to build my robotics and engineering passion.

See wiki for more!
